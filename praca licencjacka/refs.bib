abstract = {This paper tests two of the simplest and most popular tradingrules¿moving average and trading range break¿by utilizing the Dow Jones Index from 1897 to 1986. Standard statistical analysis is extended through the use of bootstrap techniques. Overall, our results provide strong support for the technical strategies. The returns obtained from these strategies are not consistent with four popular null models: the random walk, the AR(1), the GARCH-M, and the Exponential GARCH. Buy signals consistently generate higher returns than sell signals, and further, the returns following buy signals are less volatile than returns following sell signals, and further, the returns following buy signals are less volatile than returns following sell signals. Moreover, returns following sell signals are negative, which is not easily explained by any of the currently existing equilibrium models [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Finance is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

@article{Dante2010,
abstract = {This research centres on an experience which deals with multiple financial time-series. Financial data are treated by temporal mining analysis, specifically temporal association rules. These data are captured from records of the Madrid Stock Exchange (IGBM). The main goal focuses on seeking useful knowledge to explain relationships and trends amongst assets/stock prices which determine IGBM stock index. An exploratory methodology based on Knowledge Discovery (KDD) is used to cover all stages of the mining analysis: data extraction, filtering, basic forms representation, finding of important and characteristic episodes/events, construction of temporal-transactional databases and finally, searching and presentation of temporal association rules with their technical and financial conclusions. This methodology is supported on software tools by using developed libraries and graphics in R-free statistical language platform. The basic idea of mining temporal rules consists in searching and representing the repeated relationships between events obtained from these financial time-series by adding time-parameter constraints: time window (sliding window) and time lags. This process involves finding significant events into multivariate time series considering time restrictions, and then a search is made for sequences of episodes or items that are repeated amongst financial data in order to carry out a rules extraction stage. Database is connected to 20 assets (stock price time-series, in Euros) of IGBM and IGBM (index evolution, expressed in points) which conform a set of 21 financial time-series from 1993 to 2008.},

abstract = {The computerization of our society has substantially enhanced our capabilities for both generating and collecting data from diverse sources. A tremendous amount of data has flooded almost every aspect of our lives. This explosive growth in stored or transient data has generated an urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vast amounts of data into useful information and knowledge. This has led to the generation of a promising and flourishing frontier in computer science called data mining, and its various applications. Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams. This book explores the concepts and techniques of knowledge discovery and data mining. As amultidisciplinaryfield, datamining drawsonworkfromareas including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database technology, information retrieval, network science, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data visualization. We focus on issues relating to the feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability of techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets. As a result, this book is not intended as an introduction to statistics, machine learning, database systems, or other such areas, although we do provide some background knowledge to facilitate the reader’s comprehension of their respective roles in data mining. Rather, the book is a comprehensive introduction to data mining. It is useful for computing science students, application developers, and business professionals, as well as researchers involved in any of the disciplines previously listed. Data mining emerged during the late 1980s, made great strides during the 1990s, and continues to flourish into the new millennium. This book presents an overall picture of the field, introducing interesting data mining techniques and systems and discussing applications and research directions. An important motivation for writing this book was the need to build an organized framework for the study of data mining—a challenging task, owing to the extensive multidisciplinary nature of this fast-developing field. We hope that this book will encourage people with different backgrounds and experiences to exchange their views regarding data mining so as to contribute toward the further promotion and shaping of this exciting and dynamic field.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks are universal and highly flexible function approximators first used in the fields of cognitive science and engineering. In recent years, neural network applications in finance for such tasks as pattern recognition, classification, and time series forecasting have dramatically increased. However, the large number of parameters that must be selected to develop a neural network forecasting model have meant that the design process still involves much trial and error. The objective of this paper is to provide a practical introductory guide in the design of a neural network for forecasting economic time series data. An eight-step procedure to design a neural network forecasting model is explained including a discussion of tradeoffs in parameter selection, some common pitfalls, and points of disagreement among practitioners.},

As a result, there has been a critical need for automated approaches to effective and efficient utilization of massive amount of financial data to support companies and individuals in strategic planning and investment decision-making. Data mining techniques have been used to uncover hidden patterns and predict future trends and behaviors in financial markets. The competitive advantages achieved by data mining include increased revenue, reduced cost, and much improved marketplace responsiveness and awareness. There has been a large body of research and practice focusing on exploring data mining techniques to solve financial problems. In this paper, we describe data mining in the context of financial application from both technical and application perspectives. In addition, we compare different data mining techniques and discuss important data mining issues involved in specific financial applications. Finally, we highlight a number of challenges and trends for future research in this area.},
